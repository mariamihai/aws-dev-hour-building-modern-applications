# AWS Dev Hour: Building Modern Applications

Current project is based on the 2021 [Twitch series](https://pages.awscloud.com/global-traincert-twitch-dev-hour-building-modern-applications.html) hosted by Ben Newton and May Kyaw.

# The Series

## Episode 1: AWS CDK
Twitch video [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/892197005).

The focus of this week is creating the resources: <br>
- an S3 bucket will store the images <br>
- a Lambda function will be triggered by adding a new image <br>
- Amazon Rekognition will provide a set of labels <br>
- a DynamoDB table will contain the labels for a particular image

### AWS CDK

#### AWS CDK Commands
```
cdk init
```
- start new CDK project
- the project can either be an application (`cdk init app --language=[csharp|fsharp|java|javascript|python|typescript]`), 
a construct library (`cdk init lib --language=typescript`) or an application with some constructs (`cdk init sample-app --language=[csharp|fsharp|java|javascript|python|typescript]`)

``` 
cdk synth
```
- synthesize a CloudFormation template based on `lib/aws-dev-hour-building-modern-applications-stack.ts`
- the CloudFormation template is generated by default in the `cdk.out` folder
- cdk runs synth before each deployment automatically, this means that running this command before the `cdk deploy` one is optional


- eg, print the output in json for a particular stack: `cdk synth --json dev-stack`

```
cdk deploy
```
- deploy a stack to its environment
- if the result of this command is `Error: This stack uses assets, so the toolkit stack must be deployed to the environment (Run "cdk bootstrap
  aws://unknown-account/unknown-region")`, then [bootstrapping](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/bootstrapping.html) 
of the account is needed - `cdk bootstrap aws://<account>/<region>`
- [the environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/environments.html) can be set in `/bin/aws-dev-hour-building-modern-applications.ts` 
by providing the account and region (`env: { account: '<account>', region: '<region>' }`) or by using the account and region 
used by the current CLI configuration (`env: { account: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT, region: process.env.CDK_DEFAULT_REGION }`) 
- it will compare the template and tags of the current deployed stack to the template and tags that are about to be deployed 
and skips if they are identical unless `--force` is used
- if a resource fails to be created or updated, the deployment rolls back before the CLI returns. For a development stack, 
that doesn't require a consistent state at the end of an operation, `--no-rollback` or `-R` can be used
- can add parameters with `cdk deploy --parameters "Dev-Stack:TopicNameParam=parameterized" [--force]` where the parameter 
has to be used in the CDK stack:
```
new sns.Topic(this, 'TopicParameter', {
    topicName: new cdk.CfnParameter(this, 'TopicNameParam').value.toString()
});
```
- any output can be written to file by adding the `--outputs-file` (`cdk deploy --outputs-file outputs.json`), by setting 
`outputsFile` in the project's `cdk.json` file or in `~/.cdk.json`
- can hotswap deployments for faster development if the CloudFormation template has not been updated and only some resources 
where modified: `cdk deploy --hotswap [<stack-name>]`

- eg, deploy a particular stack with a particular profile: `cdk deploy <stack-name> --profile=<profile-name>`

```
cdk destroy
```
- delete a stack and the resources

### Development
AWS CLI, Node.js and AWS CDK are needed for the current project.

Initialization of the project was done by specifying the language used: `cdk init app -l typescript`

Several packages were needed: `npm install @aws-cdk/aws-s3 @aws-cdk/aws-lambda @aws-cdk/aws-lambda-event-sources @aws-cdk/aws-dynamodb @aws-cdk/aws-iam`

#### Run the application
To actual use the app run `npm install`.

#### Testing
To test the current implementation, add an image in the S3 Bucket created during `cdk deploy` either in the AWS Management 
Console or by using the cli (`aws s3 cp ../<file.jpg> s3://<bucket-name>`). The Lambda function will be triggered and the 
DynamoDB table with contain the labels for the provided images.

## Episode 2: AWS Lambda & Amazon DynamoDB
Twitch video [here](https://www.twitch.tv/aws/video/901982184).

The focus of this week is:
- creating a new S3 bucket for the thumbnail images
- updating the Lambda function used with Amazon Rekognition with a Lambda layer containing the Python library for 
resizing the images and putting this image in the newly created S3 bucket
- creating a Lambda function for interacting with the user, by either returning the labels for an image or by deleting 
the image, the labels in the DynamoDB and the thumbnail image

#### Testing
Adding an image in the initial S3 bucket (`cdk-rekn-bucket`) will trigger the Lambda function and will generate the 
thumbnail image in the second S3 bucket (`cdk-rekn-bucket-resized`) and will write the labels in the DynamoDB table 
(`ImageLabels`).

In the Lambda Management Console test the service function by providing the `getLabels` action:
```
{
  "action": "getLabels",
  "key": "<image-name>"
}
```
A JSON containing the labels should be returned:
```
{
  "image": "<image-name>",
  "object1": "<label-1>",
  "object2": "<label-2>"
}
```

The `deleteImage` action can be tested as well from the Management Console:
```
{
  "action": "deleteImage",
  "key": "<image-name>"
}
```
And the result got is `"Delete request successfully processed"` and the images are removed from both S3 buckets and the 
entry in the DynamoDb table is deleted as well.

## Episode 3: Amazon API Gateway
Twitch video [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/910524542).

The week focuses on adding a REST Api Gateway and adding integration with the service Lambda function.

The API Gateway package is needed (`npm install @aws-cdk/aws-apigateway`).

The stack was updated with an API Gateway REST API, Lambda integration and resources on `/images` (GET and DELETE). 
Getting all labels for an image will result in a call like this: `https://<GUID>.execute-api.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/<STAGE>/images?action=getLabels&key=<image-name.jpg>`

## Episode 4: AWS IAM & Amazon Cognito
